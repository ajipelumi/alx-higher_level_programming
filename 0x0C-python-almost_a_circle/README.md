**Unit Testing** is the process of testing the small units of a program.
This is done to make sure that each unit of the program is designed and working properly.

### Unittest Module
**Unittest** is one of Python frameworks for unit testing.

Its features include:
1. Test automation
2. Ability to share the setup and shutdown code for tests
3. Aggregation of the tests into collections
4. The tests are independent of the framework

When we want to test a code, we create a class that contains functions to test the particular unit of the program.

The `models` folder is a python package that contains our `Base` class, `Rectangle` class and `Square` class.

All our test files are inside the folder `tests`.
