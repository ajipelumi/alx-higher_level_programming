**JavaScript** is a high-level, dynamically typed programming language that is commonly used in web development.
It was originally created to add interactivity and dynamic effects to web pages.
JavaScript is a client-side language, which means that it runs in the user's web browser rather than on the server.
It is supported by all major web browsers and can also be used on the server side with **Node.js**.

Some of the key features of JavaScript include:
- **Variables**: JavaScript uses the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords to declare variables. It is a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime.

- **Functions**: Functions in JavaScript can be defined using the function keyword, or using arrow functions (`() => {}`). Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, and can be returned from functions.

- **Objects**: JavaScript is an object-oriented language, and objects can be created using object literals (`{}`), or using constructors and classes. Objects can have properties and methods.

JavaScript is widely used in web development for tasks such as form validation, creating dynamic interfaces, and communicating with servers through APIs.
It is also used on the server side with Node.js for tasks such as building web servers, creating command-line tools, and running scripts.

Here's an example of how you can use **va**r, **const**, and **let** to declare and assign values to variables in JavaScript:
```javascript
// Declare a variable with var
var name = "John";

// Declare a variable with let
let age = 25;

// Declare a constant with const
const PI = 3.14;

// Change the value of a variable declared with var
name = "Jane";

// Change the value of a variable declared with let
age = 26;

// You can't change the value of a constant
// This will result in a TypeError
// PI = 3.1415;

console.log(name); // Output: "Jane"
console.log(age); // Output: 26
console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14
```
