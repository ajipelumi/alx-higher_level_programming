**HTTP** stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is an application protocol for transmitting data over the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used by web browsers and servers to communicate with each other.

When a user types a URL into a web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server that hosts the website. The server responds with an HTTP response that contains the requested data, typically in the form of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

HTTP requests and responses consist of a set of headers and an optional message body. The headers contain information about the request or response, such as the method (e.g. GET or POST), the content type, the length of the message body, and any cookies or authentication credentials.

HTTP supports several different methods, or verbs, that can be used to perform different actions on the server. The most common method is GET, which is used to retrieve data from the server. Other methods include POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD, among others.

HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that each request and response is independent of any previous requests or responses. To maintain state between requests, web applications often use cookies or other techniques to store information on the client side.

Here are some of the most commonly used HTTP methods:
1. **GET**: This method is used to retrieve data from the server. When a client sends a GET request, the server responds with the requested data, typically in the form of an HTML page, image, or other resource.

2. **POST**: This method is used to submit data to the server, typically as part of a form submission. When a client sends a POST request, the server typically responds with a status code indicating whether the submission was successful.

3. **PUT**: This method is used to update an existing resource on the server. When a client sends a PUT request, the server updates the resource with the new data provided in the request.

4. **DELETE**: This method is used to delete an existing resource on the server. When a client sends a DELETE request, the server removes the resource from its database.

5. **HEAD**: This method is similar to a GET request, but it only returns the headers of the response, not the actual data. This can be useful for checking whether a resource exists on the server or for retrieving metadata about a resource.

6. **OPTIONS**: This method is used to retrieve the list of HTTP methods that are supported by a server for a given URL. When a client sends an OPTIONS request, the server responds with a list of supported methods.

HTTP Request Headers Example:
```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
Accept: */*
```

HTTP Response Headers Example:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 03 Apr 2023 18:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.46 (Ubuntu)
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 1234
```
