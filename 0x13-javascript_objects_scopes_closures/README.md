A **closure** is a feature of JavaScript that allows a function to access and remember the variables and parameters that were in its outer lexical environment (scope) when the function was defined, even if those variables and parameters are no longer in scope when the function is executed.

In simpler terms, a closure is a function that remembers the environment in which it was created, and can access and manipulate variables and parameters from that environment, even if they are no longer in scope.

Here's an example of a closure in action:
```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  
  function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
  
  return inner;
}

let closureFunc = outer(); // outer function returns inner function
closureFunc(); // Output: 1
closureFunc(); // Output: 2
closureFunc(); // Output: 3
```

In this example, the outer function creates a variable count and defines an inner function inner that increments and logs the value of count.
The outer function then returns the inner function. When we call outer(), it returns the inner function which we assign to a variable closureFunc.
When we call closureFunc(), it logs and increments the value of count.

Even though count is not directly accessible outside of the outer function, the inner function has access to it due to the closure mechanism.
This allows us to create private variables and functions in JavaScript, which can be useful for encapsulating logic and preventing unintended modifications to shared state.
