**jQuery** is a popular and widely-used JavaScript library that simplifies and streamlines the process of creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
It provides a variety of powerful tools and functions that make it easy to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events, make AJAX requests, and perform many other common tasks in web development.

One of the key features of jQuery is its ability to select and manipulate HTML elements on a page using CSS-style selectors.
This allows us to easily add, remove, or modify content and styles on a web page in response to user interactions or other events.

Here's an example of a simple jQuery script that changes the text of a button when it's clicked:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Simple jQuery Example</title>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

  <button id="myButton">Click me</button>

  <script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
      $('#myButton').click(function() {
        $(this).text('Clicked!');
      });
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
