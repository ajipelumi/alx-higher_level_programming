**Classes** and **objects** are the two main aspects of *object oriented programming*.
A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. 
An analogy is that you can have variables of type *int* which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class.

Class name in python is preceded with `class` keyword followed by a colon (`:`).
Classes commonly contains data field to store the data and methods for defining behaviors.
Also every class in python contains a special method called *initializer* (also commonly known as constructors), which get invoked automatically every time new object is created.

This README decribes what each program is doing:

The file `0-rectangle.py` is a function that defines a `Rectangle` class.

The file `1-rectangle.py` is a function that defines a rectangle by init width and height:(based on 0-rectangle.py).

The file `2-rectangle.py` is a function defines a rectangle by area and perimeter:(based on 1-rectangle.py).

The file `3-rectangle.py` is a function defines a rectangle by string representation:(based on 2-rectangle.py).

The file `4-rectangle.py` is a function defines a rectangle by repr:(based on 3-rectangle.py).

The file `5-rectangle.py` is a function defines a rectangle by deletion:(based on 4-rectangle.py).

The file `6-rectangle.py` is a function defines a rectangle by number of instances:(based on 5-rectangle.py).

The file `7-rectangle.py` is a function defines a rectangle by print symbol:(based on 6-rectangle.py).

The file `8-rectangle.py` is a function defines a rectangle by comparing rectangles:(based on 7-rectangle.py).

The file `9-rectangle.py` is a function defines a rectangle by creating rectangle instance:(based on 8-rectangle.py).

The file `101-nqueens.py` solves the N queens problem. See [here](https://github.com/ajipelumi/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x08-python-more_classes/101-nqueens.py)
