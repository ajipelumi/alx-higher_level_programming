Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not.
Testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements.

**Code that is not tested canâ€™t be trusted**

The [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/doctest.html) module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work exactly as shown.

[Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) uses methods created in classes to manage tests. It has support for automation, setup, and shutdown code when testing.

This README decribes what each script/program is doing:

All test files are inside the folder `tests`

The file `0-add_integer.py` is a function that adds 2 integers.

The file `2-matrix_divided.py` is a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

The file `3-say_my_name.py` is a function that prints `My name is <first name> <last name>`.

The file `4-print_square.py` is a function that prints a square with the character `#`.

The file `5-text_indentation.py` is a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: `.`, `?` and `:`.
